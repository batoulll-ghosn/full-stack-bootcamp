# JavaScript Challenge 2

## Goal of Challenge 2

- If else statement
- Boolean logic
- Logical operators
- Switch statement

## Step 1

1. Declare a variable `age` and assign your age as a value.
2. Using an if else statement, check whether the age is greater than or equal to 20.
   - If yes, log to the console: "You can enter this room."
   - If no, log to the console: "You can't enter this room."
3. Research about boolean logic.

```javascript
const expression1 = 5 > 3;
const expression2 = 10 === '10';
const expression3 = true && false;
const expression4 = !expression3;
```

4. Copy the above code snippet and paste it into your JS file.
5. Log to the console the 4 variables to check the result of each.
6. Commit: "Challenge 2 - Done with step 1".

## Step 2

```javascript
const age = 25;
const hasDriverLicense = true;
const hasCar = false;
```

1. Copy the above code snippet and paste it into your JS file.
2. Declare a variable `canDrive` and assign a default value of `false`.
   - Check if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and `hasDriverLicense` is `true`, then change the `canDrive` variable to `true`.
3. Declare a variable `canRentCar` and assign a default value of `false`.
   - Check if the age is greater than or equal to 22, `hasDriverLicense` is `true`, and doesn't have a car, then change the `canRentCar` variable to `true`.
4. Declare a variable `needDriver` and assign a default value of `false`.
   - Check if the age is less than 18, `hasDriverLicense` is `false`, and `hasCar` is also `false`, then change the `needDriver` variable to `true`.
5. Commit: "Challenge 2 - Done with step 2".

## Step 3

1. Declare a variable “role”, assign “admin” as a default value.
2. Using switch case:
   - If the role is admin, log to the console “You have read and write access for the data”.
   - If the role is user, log to the console “You have only read access for the data”.
   - If the role is guest, log to the console “You have no access for the data”.
   - For default, log to the console “User role is not recoginized”.
3. Commit: "Challenge 2 - Done with step 3".
